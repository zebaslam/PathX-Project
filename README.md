PathX-Project
=============
This was the final project we created in CSE219 and requires the Minigame Framework/Properties manager/Audio Manager to work properly (I have not attached the framework as it was my professor's code). This program relies heavily on Swing API and is a multithreaded point and click game. In the game, you (the player), must navigate different levels to earn money but are impeded by police, zombies and bandits who are capable of allowing you to lose the level, slow down or lose money respectively. This was the first real multi-thousand line program I have ever written.
