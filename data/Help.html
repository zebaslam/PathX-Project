            <p>PathX is a casual game where one tries to
               live a life of crime. However, unlike a typical life of crime, you steal money from immoral people. 
               The player traverses a map and tries to complete every level such that they attain the greatest amount of money possible.
               However, their journey will not be an easy one as cops, bandits and zombies will make this a difficult feat as 
               they try to steal the money you have away. Additionally, you have to try and obey traffic laws (because driving is dangerous and apparently you have a conscience) which makes for a rather challenging time.
